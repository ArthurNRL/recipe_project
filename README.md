# recipeSite
My first try at a website using Python and Django.

It's a recipe sharing site.

Up to now learned how Django works and how it handles:
- HTML/CSS styling;
- Python code in html templates;
- Django filters;
- Models;
- Sqlite databases;
- Forms;
- User registration;
- User authentication;
- Javascript/jQuery;
- Dynamic Forms;
- Pagination;
- Heroku;
- AWS S3.
